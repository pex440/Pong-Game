# My Pong Game

This is a simple pong game 

I have partially followed this tutorial: https://youtu.be/XGf2GcyHPhc 
but have decided to improve it with object oriented programming, feel free to suggest improvements, this is my first OOP Game. 

To start the game, use the Screen.py file.
Left player can move with W and S, right player can move with Up and Down Arrow Keys. 

The Speed of the ball and other parameters can be changed as an arguments of the MyScreen Instance (at the bottom of the Screen.py file). I suggest a ballspeed from 0.3 to 2, it depends from your monitor.
